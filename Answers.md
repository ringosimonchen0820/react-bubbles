1.  Explain what a token is used for. 
    A token can be used to secure data, you can set the token to be exchanged with the client if the correct password is given. Without the reception of the token the data will remain secure, but when the correct creditials are given the token is shared with the client's server, therefore giving them access to the data.

2.  What steps can you take in your web apps to keep your data secure?
    "Protected Routes", private routes that require a certain key i.e. Username and password in order to recieve a "token" that will allow them to access secured data.
